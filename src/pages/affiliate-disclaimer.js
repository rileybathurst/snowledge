    <SEO title="Affiliate Disclaimer" />
    <h1 className="regular-measure">Affiliate Disclaimer</h1>
    <p className="regular-measure">The disclosure that follows is our attempt to fully comply with the FTC’s policy that demands we be transparent about any and all affiliate relations we may have on this website. In plain English you, the visitor or customer, should assume that any and all links on this site are affiliate links. If you click on these links and go visit the resulting site, a cookie will be set in your web browser that will cause us to receive a commission “IF” you purchase a product on the other end. This is a legitimate way to monetize and pay for the operation of web sites and we gladly reveal our affiliate relationships to you.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">In addition we fully disclose that hyperlinks on this site are in most cases shortened, and in some cases cloaked to hide long ugly links for functionality and tracking purposes. We have nothing to hide and we are proud of our relationship with the fine vendors, products and services found on this site. Link tracking, shortening and cloaking is a very common practice on all types of web sites.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">Further, we do not receive physical products or cash directly in exchange for any reviews or posts you find on this site. No one has paid us to do reviews or posts. We have to tell you that it is possible that our reviews and posts are influenced by our affiliate relationships and may create a conflict of interest. We do not believe a conflict of interest exists, but you, the visitor or customer, must decide by considering the affiliate relationships and link techniques we have described. Obviously we would like you to buy the service or products we write about and we are influenced by that fact. We avoid conflict by only reviewing or posting about products and services we trust. We strive to always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on topics or products we write about and promote.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">Other vendors may also pay to place advertising on our sites in the form of banners, widgets, and hyperlinks. These are paid advertisements and while we do our best to only allow quality products and services to be advertised on our site, we are not responsible for claims or testimonials made on paid advertising links.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">The following represents a more legally worded document but basically states the same information presented in the English Translation above.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">Compensation & Affiliate Disclaimer policy, valid from 05/03/2019 on.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">As directed by the FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, (see 16 CFR Part 255) – Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, the purpose of this policy is to establish any compensatory affiliation between the site owner and the Amazon affiliate network and any individual vendors they represent.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">This website is operated and maintained by Snowledge Corp. For questions about this website, please contact us.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">This website may at times accept forms of cash advertising, sponsorship, paid insertions or other forms of affiliate compensation.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">The compensation received may or may not influence the advertising content, topics or posts made on this site. That content, advertising space or post may not always be identified as paid or sponsored content. Not all content is written or presented for the sole purpose of receiving affiliate income.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">The owner(s) of this website is compensated through various affiliate programs and some content presents opinions on products, services, websites and various other topics. Even though the owner(s) of this website may receive affiliate compensation for reviews or advertisements, we always give our honest opinions, findings, beliefs, or experiences on those topics or products. The views and opinions expressed on this website are purely our own. Any product claim, statistic, quote or other representation about a product or service should be verified with the manufacturer, provider or party in question.</p>

    <p className="regular-measure">This website does contain some content which may or may not present a conflict of interest. This content may not always be immediately identified due to the nature of posting methods. When possible every attempt will be made to identify advertising from general non-advertising content.
